# Perceiving Permissions

## Permission Tweaking Practice
This challenge will ask you to change the permissions of the /challenge/pwn file in specific ways a few times in a row. If you get the permissions wrong, the game will reset and you can try again. If you get the permissions right eight times in a row, the challenge will let you chmod /flag to make it readable for yourself :-) Launch /challenge/run to get started!

### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{EGwJMXZUrBIoP7TlS0qE2TGVh4C.QXwEjN0wiNzAzNzEzW}`

In this challenge, I followed the given instructions and kept changing permissions using ```chmod``` until I eventually got the flag.

```bash
/challenge/run
chmod
```
