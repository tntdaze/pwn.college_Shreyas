# Practicing Piping

## Redirecting output
In this challenge, you must use this output redirection to write the word PWN (all uppercase) to the filename COLLEGE (all uppercase).

### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{kyNvCT743LGDdUlkFAt4ZJaVEm5.QX0YTN0wiNzAzNzEzW}`

In this challenge, I used echo command using ```PWN > COLLEGE``` to write the word into the file and got the flag.

```bash
echo PWN > COLLEGE
```
