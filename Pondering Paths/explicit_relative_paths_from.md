This challenge will get you using . in your relative paths.

### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{M1Ny0yBb8LzhEh4c2cGCuMEN6mo.QXwUTN0wiNzAzNzEzW}`

In this challenge, I used cd command to change directory to / and then ran ```./challenge/run``` command by using . in relative path to get the flag.

```bash
cd /
./challenge/run
```
