# Pondering Paths

## Program and absolute paths
This challenge again requires you to execute it by invoking its absolute path. You'll want to execute the run file that is in the challenge directory that is, in turn, in the / directory. If you invoke the challenge correctly, it will give you the flag.

### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{0gJRIPz6PcFR2JJYVH8svdTN6Ix.QX1QTN0wiNzAzNzEzW}`

In this challenge, I typed /challenge/run using absolute path to get the flag. 

```bash
/challenge/run
```

### New Learnings
Learned how to invoke slightly more complicated paths.
