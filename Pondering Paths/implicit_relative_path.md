# Pondering Paths

## implicit relative path
In this level, we'll practice referring to paths using . a bit more. This challenge will need you to run it from the /challenge directory.

### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{80cW560qEg8lV9rckZIuZ_qphKa.QXxUTN0wiNzAzNzEzW}`

In this challenge, I used cd command to change directory to /challenge and then ran ```./run``` command by using . in relative path to get the flag.

```bash
cd /challenge
./run
```
