# Comprehending Commands

## more catting practice
In this level, I'll put the flag in some crazy directory, and I will not allow you to change directories with cd, so no cat flag for you. You must retrieve the flag by absolute path, wherever it is.

### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{gcpRP4kK0hYdaGCxIk7yEQaT1Nd.QXwITO0wiNzAzNzEzW}`

In this challenge, the terminal gave the absolute path of the flag so using that I typed ```cat /path``` to get the flag.

```bash
cat /usr/local/lib/flag
```

### New Learnings
Practiced more catting commands.
