# File Globbing

## Tab completion
This challenge has copied the flag into /challenge/pwncollege, and you can freely cat that file. But you can't type the filename: we used some serious trickery to make sure that you must tab-complete it. Try it out!

### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{ES1VTymn_XhoVnAAB9iDEXwHKtk.0FN0EzNxwiNzAzNzEzW}`

In this challenge, I typed in ```/challenge/pwn``` and hit TAB using cat command and entered it to get the flag.

```bash
cat /challenge/pwn<TAB>
```

### New Learnings
