# File Globbing

## Multiple options for tab completion
This challenge has a /challenge/files directory with a bunch of files starting with pwncollege. Tab-complete from /challenge/files/p or so, and make your way to the flag!

### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{IdfHswAWsMJcAhHQ7Mp7qtuowQp.0lN0EzNxwiNzAzNzEzW}`

In this challenge, I typed in ```/challenge/files/p``` and kept using TAB to eventually find the flag in one of the files.

```bash
cat /challenge/pwn<TAB>
```
