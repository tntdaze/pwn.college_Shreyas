# Processes and Jobs

## Resuming Processes
This challenge's run needs you to suspend it, then resume it. Good luck!

### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{E0M4bv7EGTZSIehQ5kh8ZEh3uNa.QX2QDO0wiNzAzNzEzW}`

In this challenge, I ran ```/challenge/run``` then hit ctrl+z and used the ```fg``` command which printed the flag.

```bash
/challenge/run
ctrl+z
fg
```

### New Learnings
