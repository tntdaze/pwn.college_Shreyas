# Processes and Jobs

## Interrupting Processes
Try it here! /challenge/run will refuse to give you the flag until you interrupt it. Good luck!

### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{sZv-RVobLY3WQrQ2UpfSjCgYjP0.QXzQDO0wiNzAzNzEzW}`

In this challenge, I ran ```/challenge/run``` and hit ctrl+c to stop the terminal to get the flag.

```bash
/challenge/run
ctrl+c
```
