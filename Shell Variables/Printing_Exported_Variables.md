## Printing Exported Variables
Try the env command: it'll print out every exported variable set in your shell, and you can look through that output to find the FLAG variable!

### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{A8QDoPClPItIaX3rAa3EjVkLsey.QX4UTN0wiNzAzNzEzW}`

In this challenge, I typed the ```env``` command and found the FLAG variable which contained the flag.

```bash
env
```
