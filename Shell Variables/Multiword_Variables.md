# Shell Variables

## Multi-word Variables
In this level, you'll need to set the variable PWN to COLLEGE YEAH. Good luck!

### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{oSJdZm4mViKNYtU0uyPnnrfUPwC.QXwYTN0wiNzAzNzEzW}`

In this challenge, I set "COLLEGE YEAH" to PWN using quotes and it printed out the flag.

```bash
PWN="COLLEGE YEAH"
```
