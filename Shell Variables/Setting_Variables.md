# Shell Variables

## Setting Variables
To solve this level, you must set the PWN variable to the value COLLEGE. Be careful: both the names and values of variables are case-sensitive! PWN is not the same as pwn and COLLEGE is not the same as College.

### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{o1o8Uz5f8wlBeg9A1gq2Nc1ysmk.QX5UTN0wiNzAzNzEzW}`

In this challenge, I set COLLEGE to PWN and it printed out the flag.

```bash
PWN=COLLEGE
```
