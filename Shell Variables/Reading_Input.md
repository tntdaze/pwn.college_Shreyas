# Shell Variables

## Reading Input
In this challenge, your job is to use read to set the PWN variable to the value COLLEGE. Good luck!

### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{EIXPZMKAzyS4BhCnpy9wrw2BOnw.QX4cTN0wiNzAzNzEzW}`

In this challenge, I used read on PWN first and then stored COLLEGE into PWN and got the flag.

```bash
PWN=COLLEGE
```
