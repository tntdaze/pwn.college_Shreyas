# Terminal Multiplexing

## Switching Windows
Attach to the session with screen -r, then use one of the key combinations above to switch to Window 1. Go get that flag!

### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{Ys6QikI5NKBXgRFDLQRIc5vx7D1.0FO4IDOxwiNzAzNzEzW}`

In this challenge, I used ```screen -ls``` to list out all current screens and attached to the ```challenge_session``` where it gave a welcome message and told to switch to window 0, so I used ```ctrl+a 0``` to switch and got the flag.

```bash
screen -ls
screen -r challenge_session
ctrl+a 0
```
