# Hello Hackers

## Command History
You're going to type a lot of commands, and typing everything from scratch can be annoying. Luckily, the shell saves a history of every command you invoke.

### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{sk5Tjirv8SVIqRwHmQOzmdUnM5E.0lNzEzNxwiNzAzNzEzW}`

In this challenge, I used up-arrow to get the flag.

### New Learnings
Learned the usefulness of up/down arrow keys to re-use commands.
