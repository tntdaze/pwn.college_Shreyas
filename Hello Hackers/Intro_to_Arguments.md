# Hello Hackers

## Intro to Arguments
In this challenge, to get the flag, you must run the hello command (NOT the echo command) with a single argument of hackers. Try it now!

### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{MDBpRGfvXzuvzmRxyam89DCqIpy.QX4YjM1wiNzAzNzEzW}`

In this challenge, I first ran the commands like ```hackershello```, ```hackers hello``` and then understood that hackers needs to be the argument with hello as command. Then, after correcting it I got the flag.

```bash
hello hackers
```
