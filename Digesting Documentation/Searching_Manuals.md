# Digesting Documentation

## Searching Manuals
Find the option that will give you the flag by reading the challenge man page.

### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{EwCjmGbol9P7rDrvdXJgmZBIIQ7.QX1EDO0wiNzAzNzEzW}`

In this challenge, I used ```man challenge``` to get the manual and used ```/flag``` and found ```--huvklow``` as the argument to be used to get the flag.

```bash
man challenge
/challenge/challenge --huvklow
```
