# Chaining Commands

## Scripting with Conditionals
For this challenge, write a script at /home/hacker/solve.sh that:

Takes one argument
If the argument is "pwn", output "college"
For any other input, output nothing

### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{s9qGZaMAbclkgF7csPkfkGQ6x5z.0lNzMDOxwiNzAzNzEzW}`

In this challenge, I first appended the entire ```if then fi``` conditions into ```solve.sh``` then tried running with pwn as argument and no argument which worked. So, I ran ```/challenge/run``` and got the flag.

```bash
bash solve.sh pwn
bash solve.sh
/challenge/run
```
