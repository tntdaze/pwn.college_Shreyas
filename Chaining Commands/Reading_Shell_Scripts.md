# Chaining Commands

## Reading Shell Scripts
In this level, we will learn to read shell scripts. /challenge/run is a shell script that requires you to put in a secret password, but that password is hardcoded into the script iself! Read the script (using, say, cat), figure out the password, and get the flag!

### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{kVQq0sgRrkE0FI0UH175Lh-YpNc.0lMwgDOxwiNzAzNzEzW}`

In this challenge, I ran ```echo "hack the PLANET"``` onto the file using pipe operator ```|``` and got the flag.

```bash
echo "hack the PLANET" | /challenge/run
```
