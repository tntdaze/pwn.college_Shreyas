## Understanding Shebangs
For this challenge, create a script at /home/hacker/solve.sh that has a proper shebang and outputs "hack the planet". Remember to make it executable, then run /challenge/run to verify your script works correctly!

### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{oB4BCNW9CVYAsqMBNhuYpEUyxu6.0VOzMDOxwiNzAzNzEzW}`

In this challenge, I used ```echo '#!/bin/bash' > solve.sh``` to keep the it a shebang file. Next, I ran ```echo 'echo "hack the planet"' >> solve.sh``` to append it to the file and then I used ```chmod``` and changed the permission for it to be executable and ran ```/challenge/run``` and got the flag.

```bash
echo '#!/bin/bash' > solve.sh
echo 'echo "hack the planet"' >> solve.sh
chmod u=rwx solve.sh
/challenge/run
```
