# Chaining Commands

## Handling Failure
In this challenge, you need to chain /challenge/first-failure and /challenge/second using the || operator. Go for it!

### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{og7S3W6hhvJI_3Hf7nLGeU0WHct.01M0MDOxwiNzAzNzEzW}`

In this challenge, I ran ```/challenge/first-failure``` separated by ```||``` and ```/challenge/second``` to get the flag.

```bash
/challenge/first-failure || /challenge/second
```
