# Chaining Commands

## Chaining with Semicolons
Give it a try now! In this level, you must run /challenge/pwn and then /challenge/college, chaining them with a semicolon.

### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{M6-Blp1LDQ6ITrV5JVwue0gvd3r.QX1UDO0wiNzAzNzEzW}`

In this challenge, I used semicolon to separate ```/challenge/pwn``` and ```/challenge/college``` and got the flag.

```bash
/challenge/pwn; /challenge/college
```
