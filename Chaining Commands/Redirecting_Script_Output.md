# Chaining Commands

## Redirecting Script Output
In this level, we will practice piping (|) from your script to another program. Like before, you need to create a script that calls the /challenge/pwn command followed by the /challenge/college command, and pipe the output of the script into a single invocation of the /challenge/solve command!

### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{gB1cuYQODRS4O6Pseg1dwxVUnuv.QX4ETO0wiNzAzNzEzW}`

In this challenge, I ran used ```echo``` with argument ```/challenge/pwn; /challenge/college``` onto ```x.sh``` and used bash on it with pipe operator ```| /challenge/solve``` and got the flag.

```bash
echo "/challenge/pwn; /challenge/college" > x.sh
bash x.sh | /challenge/solve
```

### New Learnings
Learned about shell script output.
