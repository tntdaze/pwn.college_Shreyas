# Chaining Commands

## Scripting with Default Cases
For this challenge, write a script at /home/hacker/solve.sh that:

Takes one argument
If the argument is "pwn", output "college"
For any other input, output "nope"

### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{80Q2yzN_2QWANuLJo1Ab4dlGR96.01NzMDOxwiNzAzNzEzW}`

In this challenge, I first appended the entire ```if then else fi``` conditions into ```solve.sh``` then tried running with pwn as argument and no argument which worked. So, I ran ```/challenge/run``` and got the flag.

```bash
bash solve.sh pwn
bash solve.sh
/challenge/run
```
