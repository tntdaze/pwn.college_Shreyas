# Chaining Commands

## Scripting with Arguments
For this challenge, you need to write a script at /home/hacker/solve.sh that:

Takes two arguments
Outputs them in REVERSE order (second argument first, then the first argument)

### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{YsEr_Dj8Y_hhnpJ7UUUo-dYLC61.0VNzMDOxwiNzAzNzEzW}`

In this challenge, I appended ```echo "$2 $1"``` into the ```solve.sh``` file so that if it takes 2 arguments it prints argument 2 first then argument 1 and I ran ```/challenge/run``` to get the flag.

```bash
nano solve.sh
echo "$2 $1"
/challenge/run
```
